[![LakeReflections](/images/lake_reflections.jpg)](https://500px.com/photo/248954203/lake-reflections-by-nicoletta-bendevi)

The year is 2019 and I need a place where I can write my own guides, thoughts or whatever I think might be of interest to others. Of course one could do that on Medium, Facebook, Linkedin or other but then you have limited control over your own writings. Creating a blog is really simple and cheap so here we are.

This is the very first post, in a blog that no one reads (yet) but it could be a start of something good. Every tree starts small but not all trees grow to the same size. Hoping this will evolve to something useful...

puts "Hello World!"
